### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I am a web developer with a passion for creating web applications that solve real business problems. I have extensive experience in automating workflows and processes, and I enjoy working directly with clients to understand their needs and deliver custom solutions.

I have a strong proficiency in the MERN stack and can develop web applications independently from start to finish. In my previous role, I enjoyed mentoring new team members, conducting exams, and writing technical documentation.

If you're looking for a developer who can deliver tailored web solutions and communicate effectively with clients, then I'm your guy. [Let's chat!](https://t.me/Alex_Conglomerate)
