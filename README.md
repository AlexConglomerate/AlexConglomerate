## Hello! ðŸ‘‹
I'm a web developer with a passion for solving real business problems through custom web applications. I have extensive experience in automating workflows and processes, and I enjoy working directly with clients to understand their needs and deliver tailored solutions.

I'm proficient in the MERN stack and can develop web applications independently from start to finish. I enjoy mentoring and helping team members, conducting exams, and writing technical documentation.
